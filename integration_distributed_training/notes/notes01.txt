- find out what doesn't work with gradient_variance
- run on jobdispatch at MILA
- plot information for training based on stdout


50419.0.out    ->    config 26892    (Maybe an old experiment left there by accident ?)

50423.0.out    ->    config 87360    1 workers, learning rate 0.001
                                     (Failed on bootstrap stage. File not even created.)

50424.0.out    ->    config 26892    8 workers, learning rate 0.001
                                     (Possible conflict with other config 26892 running at same time.)
                                     (Something has gone wrong. Ends with train loss mean 89319384.0, but other quantities are okay. Find where something happened. )


50425.0.out    ->    config 87361    1 worker, learning rate 0.0001
                                     (Failed on bootstrap stage. File not even created.)

50426.0.out    ->    config 26893    8 workers, learning rate 0.0001
                                     (Trains successfully with  accuracy : mean 0.845443.)


Want to plot 50424 and 50426.
