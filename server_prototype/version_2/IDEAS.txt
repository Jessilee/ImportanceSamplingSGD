Track the distributions of the delays between updates to importance_weight.
This could be a better way to characterize the training than to look at the
number of workers, since we don't really care about the number of workers
so long as they do their job as fast as possible.

Track also the distribution of delays between parameter updates. See how long
workers operate with stale parameters on average. Another important measure.
